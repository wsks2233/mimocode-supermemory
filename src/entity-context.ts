export const AGENT_ENTITY_CONTEXT = `Shared coding-agent memory for one software repository.

RULES:
- Remember what a human teammate would remember: decisions, lessons, preferences, and durable project knowledge
- Preserve context that helps Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or Cursor continue the work later
- Condense assistant responses into decisions, outcomes, and reusable knowledge
- Keep user preferences and project facts concise and independently understandable
- Prefer why a choice was made and what was learned over mechanical progress updates

EXTRACT:
- User preferences, accepted decisions, durable workflows, outcomes, and lessons learned
- Architecture: "uses monorepo with turborepo", "API in /apps/api"
- Conventions: "components in PascalCase", "hooks prefixed with use"
- Patterns: "all API routes use withAuth wrapper", "errors thrown as ApiError"
- Setup: "requires .env with DATABASE_URL", "run pnpm db:migrate first"
- Decisions: "chose Drizzle over Prisma for performance", "using RSC for data fetching"

SKIP:
- Generic assistant suggestions the user did not accept
- Transient repository state Git already tracks: current branch or commit, uncommitted files and diffs, and in-flight commit, push, or PR status
- Transient command output and low-value implementation chatter
- Granular details that do not help future work`;

// Backwards-compatible aliases. Entity context is stored on the container, so
// every agent must send the same combined context for the shared repository tag.
